# Anime Watchlist App

[View the live project here.]()

this app was created to help keep track of all the diffrent titles you've seen,
speaking from experience this is a very useful app when you've seen over 100 different ones.

**User Goals:**

- to keep track of all the different titles you've seen.
- to make sure the title you want to add to the list is not already there.

**Site Owner Goals:**

- to help the user easily add titles to the list.
- double check the users inputs to make sure the titles are not the same.

## How to Use

Its pretty simple you type in the title you wish to add to or edit in the list to get started
and then get follow up questions based on user inputs and just to make sure the list is normal 
you have to type in specified words for the program to take you to the next step, so you don't have to
worry about making some kind of mistake.
